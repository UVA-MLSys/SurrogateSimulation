# Introduction

We are driven by the mission to develop a state-of-the-art earthquake prediction model that combines accuracy with efficiency. Earthquakes, with their sudden and devastating impact, call for timely and reliable solutions to minimize their consequences on society and infrastructure. Our goal is to create a surrogate model that matches the precision of traditional physics-based models while drastically reducing computation time. By harnessing the power of machine learning and advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to revolutionize earthquake forecasting. Our model will provide rapid assessments of seismic activity and predictive insights, enabling timely warnings and empowering emergency response efforts.
