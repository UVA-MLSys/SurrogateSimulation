Introduction

Earthquakes pose a significant threat to human lives and infrastructure, necessitating accurate prediction models for timely responses. Traditional physics-based simulations and monitoring systems, while accurate, often require substantial computational time. This research aims to develop a surrogate model that matches the accuracy of physics-based models while significantly reducing computation time. By utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques, the study seeks to create a surrogate model for quick seismic activity assessment and earthquake prediction, enabling timely warnings and effective emergency response.


Problem Statement

The research addresses the need for accurate and computationally efficient earthquake prediction models. By bridging this gap, the study aims to advance industry practices in earthquake forecasting, specifically in risk assessment and location prediction. The research seeks to answer the following research question: How much time can be saved by employing a surrogate model for earthquake prediction compared to typical physics-based or computational models?
